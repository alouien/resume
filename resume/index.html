During the Summer and winter  Xgames i learned great team building skills. We had a venue spread across  a mountain in aspen  and would have to effectively communicate over radio to sufficiently do our job. We were in charge of athlete/consumer relations as well so i was in charge of keeping the public under control while the athletes performed their tasks. I also helped construct many buildings and the super pipe/skatepark itself which helped me develop my critical thinking skills.<br>
